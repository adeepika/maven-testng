Basic structure for UI testing for Accomplice web application
This is a work in progress. Few points:

1. We use Selenium Webdriver API for browser automation
2. Maven is used ot drive testng through surefire plugin
3. Testng config file "testng.xml" is used to confgire testng behaviour
4. Tests are written in test classes in "io.accomplice.testing.selenium.testclasses"
5. Util classes are written in "io.accomplice.testing.selenium.utils"
